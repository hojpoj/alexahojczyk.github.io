              <li><strong>Company</strong>: Empyrean</li>
              <li><strong>Platforms Covered</strong>: iOS, Android, Responsive Web</li>
              <li><strong>Target Users</strong>: All Empyrean clients and their employees</li>
              <li><strong>Deliverables</strong>: Design system components, patterns, and libraries designed in Axure, Adobe XD, and Figma with interactive prototyping capabilities included for our designers as well as created in a way that developers can use for reference during their creation processes, Design system documentation from both technical and non-technical perspectives, Design system strategy for how we work to create an initial design system, how we maintain in, and how we plan to keep it scalable as our products grow and expand, Design component/pattern backlog creation and maintenance, Design token creation for development</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              With UX being a very new addition to Empyrean, many improvements and opportunity areas are still being uncovered. One of the main areas consistently pointed out by users and clients is the lack of consistency across Empyrean products. As a way to standardize UX and UI across platforms, I was brought on to help stand up a design system to not only help with consistency, but also with accessibility and efficiency. I have been responsible for standing up, creating, and maintaining our design system from a UX perspective as well as acting as a product manager on the product and engineering sides of the projects as well.
