            As a lead UX strategist, I focus on constructing the blueprint for user-centric features/products using research-based, user-informed approaches. I work cross-functionally with Product, Engineering, and Product Design/Research leadership in order to dig deep into proposed problems, ensuring the correct problem is being targeted and developing the best strategic approaches and solutions to those key problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            While my focus has been in UX strategy, research, accessibility, and design operations in my most recent years in the industry, I have experience across every subarea of UX from research to design to interactive prototypes, etc as well as experience as a front end software engineer. I enjoy leveraging my knowledge in all fields in order to strengthen the designs and strategies I create for my users as well as guarantee 100% alignment between user and business needs.

              We’ve heard this expression multiple times, but as I’ve progressed in my career, I have always worked towards staying as far ahead as possible. I work to make sure that my team and I are constantly considering what comes next after we complete current tasks to make sure we’re on top of the game and we’re already tackling the next problem instead of trying to panic and solve it last minute with less than desirable parameters.

              A principle that applies to everything, not just research, I try to stay as informed as possible in every step of the process to make the best decisions possible. Staying informed through research/data, design progress, engineering progress, product needs, communication, etc is key to making sure I have enough information while working on complex systems to know which direction to head in next.

              Accessibility has always been of key importance to me from the very first job I had as a front end software engineer/UX designer. While I love when people practice any kind of accessibility, I love to incorporate universal design principles rather than just inclusive design principles as my personal belief is that if you’re designing according to best practices, you’ll be creating one solution that works for all your users instead of having to design an unnecessary amount of additional solutions that aim to correct what was missing from the first solution.

            Across the Streaming Content, Personal Media, and Playback product teams at Plex, I led all UX strategy and research efforts over the past couple years. One of the major projects for these teams started when the Streaming Content team was formed. This project was to overhaul and revamp the FAST and AVOD services on Plex. During this project, I conducted multiple usability studies across FAST and AVOD services on multiple mobile, web, and TV platforms, mapped out major flows, and facilitated workshops around all UX strategy and research findings to determine action items aligned with both product and design’s goals.

              Metadata-wise, FAST and AVOD had to be separated by content type as well, with FAST separating into movies, TV shows, and new and AVOD splitting into movie and TV shows; these content types also had differing metadata between not only platform but between FAST and AVOD representations

                  <p>The beginning of both of these project started as a pretty ambiguous "hey, let's fix FAST/AVOD" from my product managers so the first step was to sit down and figure out the who, what, when, where, and why. I set up a meeting with my key stakeholders to figure out the problem(s) they were wanting to solve, metrics they wanted to target, any target users they had in mind, and a timeline.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>For FAST: My product managers wanted to tackle two main problems: the lack of consistency of the FAST experience across all supported platforms (the platforms of focus ended up being iOS, Android, watch.plex (web), app.plex (web), Fire TV, Roku, and LG/Lightning. The process started with identifying what's actually happening in FAST, if it aligns with best practices in the industry, figure out how to bring it to a consistent state across platforms that users would be happy with, and then start figuring out areas of improvement for future iterations of FAST.</li>
                    <li>For AVOD: The same problems as above were identified, but for a user group, we focused a lot less on PMS users and more on general users in order to improve the experience to focus more on retention and registration.</li>

                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>After the initial meeting with stakeholders, I went onto non-user/market research. For this round of research, I focused on trying to find any existing documentation/research/wireframes/mockups that may be able to help target inconsistencies, walking through the application on target platforms to understand and map out flows/inconsistencies, and look at competitors to understand what best practices appear to be across streaming services. This resulted in the following:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Metadata Analysis and Usability Analysis: To start tackling the consistency issues across platforms, I started off by conducting a metadata analysis for FAST/AVOD. The metadata analysis consisted of walking through each major page within the FAST/AVOD flows, wireframing them out completely (paying extra attention to the formatting and display of metadata), and then walking through to see the best way to standardize formatting across platforms. I also was able to use these wireframes to map out feature/usability inconsistencies and recommendations around them. Part of the flows for TV FAST apps is shown to the right.</li>
                    <li>Competitive Analysis: While looking through competitors, I conducted a few analyses centered around the following: metadata formatting across FAST/AVOD, general structure/flow of FAST/AVOD, and general page organization. For these analyses, I maintained a list of 11 competitors (5 direct, 6 indirect) for AVOD and a list of between 10-15 competitors for FAST (this varied based on users and functionality being considered). Direct competitors were streaming services that were free ad-supported services, indirect competitors were paid streaming services.</li>

                  <p>With the information collected from the non-user research, I wrote up a test plan for usability research across FAST/AVOD platforms.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>For the FAST study: The target users were initially focused around non-PMS (personal media server) users that watched at least 1-2 hours of live TV on a weekly basis, not specifically on Plex, but in general. Mobile, web, and TV platforms were targeted for this study. Users were asked to walk through the way they would typically use FAST, describing anything they liked/disliked/etc and then were asked questions around their experience, their watching habits, etc at the end to understand user behavior and content consumption. The study initially had over 80 participants, with about 40-50 usable studies used for research analysis as the study was unmoderated through UserTesting.com.</li>
                    <li>For the AVOD study: The target users were focused around non-PMS (personal media server) users that watched at least 1-2 hours of live TV on a weekly basis, not specifically on Plex, but in general. Mobile, web, and TV platforms were targeted for this study. Users were asked to walk through the way they would typically use AVOD, describing anything they liked/disliked/etc and then were asked questions around their experience, their watching habits, etc at the end to understand user behavior and content consumption.

                  <p>With all the research conducted, I put together a synthesis of my findings, also including in a JTBD persona for each study as requested by my product team. After presenting the synthesis to my product team as well as various other stakeholders, I was able to put together a brainstorming workshop to use with my stakeholders to generate new feature ideas for FAST and AVOD. From the brainstorming workshops, I took the most popular ideas and put them into a prioritization matrix and eventually a UX strategy/research/design backlog for future iterations of each flow. Below are snippets from the AVOD synthesis, brainstorming workshop, and prioritization matrix.</p>

          <p>
            Focused on the Discover product team at Plex, I led a majority of the UX strategy and research efforts over the past couple years. One of the major projects for this team was centered around Plex’s Discover feature, which allows a user to search and browse across all their streaming services in one place. In addition to show tracking, search improvements were done in conjunction in order to better serve both PMS and non-PMS users with more relevant search results. A majority of the project focused around low fidelity wireframes across platforms to fine tune an intuitive process. The search improvements created from this project are in current state Plex.

                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>The need for this project came from consistent feedback we had been getting from users about how search wasn't the greatest. Some of the feedback from users included the following:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Users wanted more functionality such as genre search</li>
                    <li>Users thought that the results given weren't that relevant to what they had originally searched for</li>
                    <li>Users thought some of the text wasn't readable and that the posters were too small</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Search is a major feature for Plex, not just because search is important for any streaming service, but also because Plex had universal search; you're able to search across your personal media content, Plex's content, and content from all other streaming services on the market. My product manager approached me to help evaluate and improve search and so, search improvements started.</p>
                  <p>We had a fairly clear baseline of what we wanted to do based off of user feedback, but starting off, my product team and I decided to focus mainly on our web platforms (Plex has two web platforms: watch.plex.tv and app.plex.tv). Feature-wise, we wanted to focus on genre search, search results display (both for quick search and full page results), and filtering.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>In order to establish a baseline of what search is like across platforms, I did a competitive analysis of 10 different streaming services to figure out the similarities and differences between search functionality on their web apps as well as their TV apps (TV would be the next focus after we had a firm blueprint for web). Once I had a good understanding of the baseline search functionality, I met with Product to see if there was anything in particular that they liked/didn't like from competitors that we could incorporate into our version of search.</p>
                  <p>From establishing that baseline, I did my own due diligence of mapping out the current state search for Plex to understand if there were any inconsistencies, the areas where users were fumbling/unhappy with, and overall, all the features that we currently had that we needed to decide if we needed to carry over or get rid of because we didn't have enough usage of them for users to find them valuable.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>I started out by breaking apart the flow into four pieces: quick search, quick search results, full page results, and filtering on full page results (from previous user research, it was decided that we would remove filtering from quick search as 95% of users completely ignored it, the other 5% didn't ever use it, but acknowledged it existed).</p>
                  <p>Quick search and quick search results were probably the least complicated piece of the puzzle. I was able to split these into the formatting of the results of movies, TV shows (search only goes to the show level, not season or episode), and genres (new functionality) and the overall design of search/results. Full page results was a bit more difficult as current state sectioned everything out by location (i.e. Media Library (if applicable), Live TV, Live TV Tuner (if applicable), On Plex, etc) which led to a lot of scrolling, unnecessary whitespace, and segmentation of results. I ended up coming up with three variations, one with the segmentation intact and two with a condensed version of results. The condensed version of results also had the additional challenge of figuring out what to do with the poster/image previews for each item as they varied between each content type.</p>
                  <p>Filtering was the most complicated piece mainly because of 1.) the granularity of what we were capable of getting down to vs the granularity we wanted to get down to and 2.) what we wanted to be able to refine results by (i.e. genre, director, length, location, etc).</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>Once initial wireframes were in a good state, I reviewed them with Product, engineering, and design. We went through a few iterations before getting to a happy place and then handed designs off to the UI/UX designer I was working with on the project. As they worked on the high fidelity versions of web, I was working on the TV version of search. The web prototype would eventually be tested to confirm flow, functionality, and terminology, the results from which were applied to the TV prototype in the applicable areas.</p>

                  <p>Show tracking was a product-proposed project. The team wanted a way for users to easily track their watching progress of TV shows and movies across all streaming services (including Plex titles) within Plex. This project added functionality to a new feature on Plex called Discover. Discover is a feature where a user is able to select all the streaming services they have available to themselves and, once set, gives them the ability to browse titles across all of these services as well as Plex's curated selection. Discover is a feature majorly popular among general, non-PMS users and this ended up being our target audience for this project.</p>
                  <p>Though this feature would eventually be available on all platforms (mobile, web, TV), the main platform focused at the start was web. Working with Product off an original concept flow they created, we knew we wanted to focus on the Watchlist feature and figuring out how tracking would work when a user clicks on Watchlist from the show/season/episode levels of TV shows as well as on a movie title.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>After the initial meeting with stakeholders, I worked collaboratively with Product as I thought through different iterations of the concept flow they created. One of the challenges that needed to be considered when working on these flows was the expected behavior between deep-linking and non-deep-linking clients. Depending on the devices and service, some services (such as Firestick/Amazon) did not allow for deep-linking which would change the flow slightly for users on that platform in order to allow the Plex app to be published on that platform.</p>
                  <p>Another major challenge was just how much granularity to include as well as the numerous flows for each episode. At the time, Plex could only support going to the show level and, based on previous user research, users expressed interest in being able to track season and episode-level content. This challenge was also intertwined with the amount of flows. Movies had the simplest flows as a user has either watched a movie or they hadn't watched a movie. TV shows were different; to start, a user could have only watched one season of a multi-season show or a few episodes from different seasons, etc. It would depend on if a TV show was sequential or if it was more of an anthology-type show where each episode was its own complete story (or something in-between those two). To compensate for this, we had flows for a user who has watched all the seasons/episodes of a show, a user who has watched none of a show, and a user who has watched some of the show. Because of the complexity, this added to the debate of what level of granularity to get down into for tracking purposes.</p>
                  <p>Eventually, we were able to get to a happy point with watchlisting and the flow was passed off to the lead UI designer for high fidelity mockups.</p>

                  <p>As the high fidelity mockups were reviewed by the team, Product had decided to also include Mark as Watched to the flows as well as Watchlist and Mark as Watched would have tied together functionality. As we got further in the Mark as Watched wireframes and started to test and prototype with users and internal employees, it did become obvious that the Mark as Watched flow did get confusing and it was eventually benched for the time being to focused just on Watchlist as well as Continue Watching improvements, which were a result from initial Watchlist wires and were very intertwined as well</p>
                  <p>Wires and high fidelity mockups were eventually created for the entirety of flows for mobile, web, and TV, with usability testing being conducted in between to confirm flows and terminology with users along the way.

          <p>
            Within Enterprise applications at Fifth Third, I led all user experience and user interfaces efforts over the past year within several major projects. One of these projects was aimed at creating an external facing API portal for the bank. During this time, we conducted major competitive and user research around API portals and API integration. The end product was a fully fleshed out release plan with three phases, wireframes, site maps, style guides, branding resources, etc supplied for each phase.

                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>For this project, I was approached by one of my enterprise product teams with the desire of wanting to build an API portal for others to leverage. This would be the first externally facing product the enterprise team would have ever implemented. The target users initially were developers implementing products/applications that would require leveraging a banking API (for example, if a product wanted to leverage certain transactional functionality, they would be able to go to this portal in order to call the API and build it into their application). As far as other requirements went, it was fairly open-ended with just the general idea of an API portal.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>As the project was fairly ambiguous, my first step was to look through competitor portals to see what was generally involved with the design and usability of a banking API portal. I targeted several different portals and was able to establish a general structure most of them followed as well as what each of them offered in terms of information/functionality. As I moved through each competitor, it did bring up a question we hadn't considered before which was if we wanted to put up some kind of registration gate. For some competitors, they utilized a registration gate to hide all of their API documentation, while others didn't and just left the information open to the public.</p>
                  <p>While going through competitor portals, I was having discussions with my developers around what they had been looking at as reference and discovered that we did have a pre-existing API portal that we had never pushed to the public. With access to that portal, I did my own heuristic analysis to see where usability could be improved as well as worked towards comparing our pre-existing portal to the competitors analyzed previously.</p>

                  <p>Initially, there were no plans to interview users as the original timeline was much tighter than what it was adjusted to being. User interviews were introduced once we discovered we had more time as the API was being written (and because I bugged my product team to let me as I wanted to gather more information on functionality and previous experiences before continuing with a design).</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The first round of user interviews were conducted virtually in-person with 10 different CEOs/CTOS/engineering managers from different companies that were partnered with Fifth Third. They were recruited via the product team after explaining the concept we were planning on designing out. Interviews were 60 minute sessions focused around previous experiences, expectations for an API portal, components they liked/disliked from portals they've used/their devs have used, what they were hoping for with this new portal, etc.</li>
                    <li>The second round of user interviews were also conducted virtually in-person with 10 different software engineers who had experience actually implementing banking APIs in products they had either currently or previously worked on. Similar to the first round of interviews, these users also had 60 minute sessions focused around previous experiences, expectations for an API portal, components they liked/disliked from portals they've used/their devs have used, what they were hoping for with this new portal, etc, though with some more technically oriented questions that would be more relevant to them.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>From these interviews, I was able to synthesize my results and present my findings to my product and engineering teams, providing what I recommended as the direction we go in with the portal. We all came to a consensus on the direction and moved forward to the next steps.</p>

With those screens designed, I then created flows for each phase we had decided on for the portal, adding to the site map to show what gets added where during each phase. The site map also acted as the information architecture for the layout of the API portal.</p>
                  <p>Because of a shift in priorities for myself as well as key engineering resources, there were no further design iterations for this project. I ended up delivering a fully fleshed out release plan with three phases, wireframes, site maps, style guides, branding resources, etc supplied for each phase to my developers with the short time left I had to dedicate to the project before moving on. I also made sure they knew they could always message me with design questions as the portal got implemented, I just couldn't be a dedicated resource anymore as other projects had higher priority.</p>

                  <p>My first project as a senior product designer at Fifth Third was Bankers Dashboard. This was a pre-existing project in the middle of a complete redesign under the enterprise applications pillar of design.

                  <p>The product had no previous artifacts and a fairly tight timeline for launch of the application. The designer who had previously been working on the product did not leave any files associated with the product as they worked on everything in their own local drive and we could not gain access to any of those files so I did the following.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Worked with my product and engineering stakeholders to gain access to the current application and walked through it myself, conducting a heuristic analysis of the current state to understand where it currently was.</li>
                    <li>I combined this analysis with the PNGs of mockups the previous designer had sent over to my product stakeholders to identify the areas the designer was working on improving as well as trying to match up visual styles as the product stakeholders were very attached to the visual treatment the previous designer had created.</li>
                    <li>With what I was able to collect from stakeholders, I recreated the design as closely as I could in Sketch, checking in with Product to identify any features that I was missing in my recreation of the design.</li>

                  <p>Once I was as close as possible to what had previously been created, I worked with Product to understand what was remaining for their original MVP that they had decided on for launch before I started and worked on those components.</p>
                  <p>I was able to complete the original designs needed for MVP launch. While I wasn’t able to conduct any kind of iterative usability research, I was able to establish two sessions with users, one to confirm the MVP design in its most final state and another to reconfirm the design as the first round of research showed us a major usability issue in the original flow that needed to be addressed before launch.</p>
                  <p>From the small amount of usability testing I was able to conduct, we introduced a new post-launch MVP to address some of the concerns our users had brought up as well as functionalities and features I was able to point out weren't optimal for the user experience, but didn't have time to fix before launch.</p>

With this change, I made sure to provide as much documentation as possible to make sure designs and development were consistent across all bank applications and engineering/product had as many resources as possible to continue with future iterations of the product.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>I established a shared folder system in the cloud that documented the work that I was doing for the product that was easily accessible by anyone who would need to work on that product so that all research and designs were together in one place and not hidden away in any local drives where only one person could access them.</li>
                    <li>I established point of contact on the design system team as well as provided development with style guide and branding resources for implementation of the dashboard</li>

                  <p>For each project per office for the client, I established initial meetings conducted with the key stakeholders to understand the current application (or lack thereof) and learn the stakeholders' needs. Due to the high level of variability between clients, I tried to establish a baseline of the following:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>What, if any, previous work had been performed for the project and where any existing resources were</li>

                    <li>Who were the clients/target users for the project</li>
                    <li>What was the timeline</li>
                    <li>What are products' goals and what needed to be done</li>

                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>For most projects, the main need was for design for a product on a very strict timeline. Most frequently, this meant gathering as much information up front to be confident enough to jump into creating high fidelity mockups for an application. In the case of four major projects under GDSP (Genetic Disease Screening Program), the ask was to create a digital application based off a fully physical, pre-existing paper system. One such example of this was for Genetic Counseling Licensure (GCL). With this project, we were given a more open-ended timeline that allowed for low fidelity wireframes as well as usability testing with the final system in development.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>For most projects, it wasn't possible to meet with users in order to conduct any kind of user research. The exception to this was with GCL where we were able to fit in usability testing with the final system in a development environment.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>For this study, we had originally planned to conduct in-person, on-site moderated usability sessions with 7 participants. The sessions would be 60 minutes each, with the user walking through the system in the way they expected it to function, giving their open and honest feedback about how the process was in general as well as how it compared to the existing paper system. The users were clinicians who had their genetic counseling licenses and had completed the paper process to receive them in the state of California.</li>
                    <li>Because of the timing of the sessions, the original plan was disrupted because of the initial outbreak of COVID in San Francisco (where the client site was). With a set release date that could not be adjusted, I ended up training a few of my product managers on how to conduct the usability sessions, providing them with the script that was written and general advice on what to say/not say, etc. We ended up conducting the 7 original sessions in about 3 days that way, identifying a huge usability issue with one of the screens that was able to be fixed before launch.</li>

                  <p>With many of the small projects that had design needs, there were limited front end development resources available to help implement the designs that were created.
