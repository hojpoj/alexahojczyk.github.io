				  	<p>Within the state of California, I led all user experience and user interfaces efforts over the past two years within 10 major projects. These projects were all covered within one of the largest engagements with California. During this time, we released two new major applications that covered over 20,000+ users as well as maintained and improved the user interface and user experience within multiple pre-existing applications which affected over 500,000 users at any given time.</p>

				  	<h3 class="project_overview">Requirements Gathering</h3>
				  	<p>For each project per office for the client, I established initial meetings conducted with the key stakeholders to understand the current application (or lack there of) and learn the stakeholders' needs. Due to the high level of variability between clients, I tried to establish a baseline of the following:</p>
				  	<ul>
				  		<li>What, if any, previous work had been performed for the project and where any existing resources were</li>
				  		<li>Where the application lived (i.e. web, mobile app, public facing, private facing, etc)</li>
				  		<li>Who were the clients/target users for the project</li>
				  		<li>What was the timeline</li>
				  		<li>What are products' goals and what needed to be done</li>
				  	</ul>

				<div class="overview row">
				  <div class="project_overview_deliverables col-md">
				  	<h3 class="project_overview">High Fidelity Mockups</h3>
				  	<p>For most projects, the main need was for design for a product on a very strict timeline. Most frequently, this meant gathering as much information up front to be confident enough to jump into creating high fidelity mockups for an application. In the case of four major projects under GDSP (Genetic Disease Screening Program), the ask was to created a digital application based off a fully phyical, pre-existing paper system. One such example of this was for Genetic Counseling Licensure (GCL). With this project, we were given a more open-ended timeline that allowed for low fidelity wireframes as well as usability testing with the final system in development.</p>

				  <div class="project_overview_deliverables col-md">
				  	<h3 class="project_overview">User Research (When Applicable)</h3>
				  	<p>For most projects, it wasn't possible to meet with users in order to conduct any kind of user research. The exception to this was with GCL where we were able to fit in usability testing with the final system in a development environment.</p>
				  	<ul>
					  	<li>For this study, we had originally planned to conduct in-person, on-site moderated usability sessions with 7 participants. The sessions would be 60 minutes each, with the user walking through the system in the way they expected it to function, giving their open and honest feedback about how the process was in general as well as how it compared to the existing paper system. The users were clinicians who had their genetic counseling licenses and had completed the paper process to receive them in the state of California.</li>
					  	<li>Because of the timing of the sessions, the original plan was disrupted because of the initial outbreak of COVID in San Francisco (where the client site was). With a set release date that could not be adjusted, I ended up training a few of my product managers on how to conduct the usability sessions, providing them with the script that was written and general advice on what to say/not say, etc. We ended up conducting the 7 original sessions in about 3 days that way, identifying a huge usability issues with one of the screens that was able to be fixed before launch.</li>

				  <div class="project_overview_deliverables vertical-divider col-lg">
				  	<h3 class="project_overview">Interactive Prototypes (When Applicable)</h3>
				  	<p>With many of the small projects that had design needs, there were limited front end development resources available to help implement the designs that were created. In order to further help out on the client, I helped to provide HTML and CSS/SASS prototypes of finalized designs to the client as I have a background in front end development and computer science in general.</p>
				  </div>
				  <div class="project_overview_deliverables col-lg">
				  	<h3 class="project_overview">Accessibility/UX Guidance</h3>
				  	<p>As most project overlapped greatly and had drastically varied timelines for final designs, I constantly acted as the go-to design resource as the lead UX/UI designer on CDPH. I would provide guidance not only on designs that I had created for various offices, but also for pre-exisiting systems that need UX guidance and previously designed systems that were looking for UX upkeep.</p>
				  	<p>Within my specialization in accessibility, I also acted as a go-to accessibility resource, providing accessibility guidance, testing, evaluations, reports, and solutions on pre-exisiting and newly created products and features.</p>
				  	<p>My guidance in both of these areas stretched beyond CDPH to numerous other state projects that came up in the timeline where time permitted me to help out and provide guidance.</p>

			<h3>AVOD Brainstorming Workshop</h3>
			<p>The FAST and AVOD brainstorming workshops were formatted similarly with affinity mapping, creative matrices, and voting on ideas. Specifically for the AVOD workshop, participants started with a warm-up activity to step into the shoes of the user by recalling as many titles from the main pages of Plex as possible. We then moved onto affinity mapping, where participants were sorted through existing challenges they saw with AVOD (through personal experience and user research), dividing them into groups and then, as a group, coming up with How Might We statements based off of them. From there, we used those HMW statements for our creative matrix and then voted on items via Monopoly money. Shown below are the affinity mapping and creative matrix activities.</p>

			<h3>AVOD Prioritization Session</h3>
			<p>Items from the AVOD workshop were pulled into the matrix for prioritization. Following the initial session, I broke out the items into different sections of where research was needed, what we needed more info on in general, what were mainly dev-focused items, what were items were already got started on from a design perspective, and miscellaous, sorting each column by priority order.</p>
