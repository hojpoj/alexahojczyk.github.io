				  	<p>Within Enterprise applications at Fifth Third, I led all user experience and user interfaces efforts over the past year within several major projects. One of these projects was aimed at creating a better way for Fifth Third bankers to make taking calls and keeping track of customer needs easier and more efficient. The end product was a dashboard that was adapted to each customer’s needs, scripting for different products to discuss with customers, current state of customer issues, a notes area for the banker, etc.</p>

				  		<li>When starting on the dashboard, there was no documentation on the designs done by the previous designer so most of the dashboard had to be rebuilt from scratch</li>

				  		<li>Because of the tight timeline, it was difficult to get time to do usability testing on the mockups during the design process</li>

				  	<h3 class="project_overview">Requirements Gathering</h3>
				  	<p>My first project as a senior product designer at Fifth Third was Bankers Dashboard. This was a pre-existing project in the middle of a complete redesign under the enterprise applications pillar of design. I was introduced to the project via the lead product manager on the project and got an overview from her on what the project was and some time to gain my bearings and get comfortable with the design.</p>

				  <div class="project_overview_deliverables col-md">
				  	<h3 class="project_overview">Resource Gathering</h3>
				  	<p>The product that had no previous artifacts and had a fairly tight timeline for launch of the application. The designer who had previously been working on the product did not leave any files associated with the product as they worked on everything in their own local drive and we could not gain access any of those files so I did the following.</p>
				  	<ul>
				  		<li>Worked with my product and engineering stakeholders to gain access to the current application and walked through it myself, conducting a heuristic analysis of the current state to understand where it currently was.</li>
				  		<li>I combined this analysis with the PNGs of mockups the previous designer had sent over to my product stakeholders to identify the areas the designer was working on improving as well as trying to match up visual styles as the product stakeholders were very attached to the visual treatment the previous designer had created.</li>
				  		<li>With what I was able to collect from stakeholders, I recreated the design as closely as I could in Sketch, checking in with product to identify any features that I was missing in my recreation of the design.</li>
				  	</ul>

				  	<h3 class="project_overview">High Fidelity Flows Part 1 and Part 2 & MVP Definition</h3>
				  	<p>Once I was as close as possible to what had previously been created, I worked with product to understand what was remaining for their original MVP that they had decided on for launch before I started and worked on those components.</p>
				  	<p>I was able to complete the original designs needed for MVP launch. While I wasn’t able to conduct any kind of iterative usability research, I was able to establish two sessions with users, one to confirm the MVP design in its most final state and another to reconfirm the design as the first round of research showed us a major usability issue in the original flow that needed to be addressed before launch.</p>
				  	<p>From the small amount of usability testing I was able to conduct, we introduced a new post-launch MVP to address some of the concerns our users had brought up as well as functionalities and features I was able to point out weren't optimal for the user experience, but didn't have time to fix before launch.</p>

				  	<h3 class="project_overview">Documentation Hand-off</h3>
				  	<p>After about a year and a half as the dedicated design resource for Bankers Dashboard, my priorities shifted as the role of Senior UX Producer was created for me and I stepped into design operations/design strategy work full time. With this change, I made sure to provide as much documentation as possible to make sure designs and development were consistent across all bank applications and engineering/product had as many resources as possible to continue with future iterations of the product.</p>
				  	<ul>
				  		<li>I established a shared folder system in the cloud that documented the work that I was doing for the product that was easily accessible by anyone who would need to work on that product so that all research and designs were together in one place and not hidden away in any local drives where only one person could access them.</li>
				  		<li>I established point of contact on the design system team as well as provided development with style guide and branding resources for implementation of the dashboard</li>

			<h3>AVOD Brainstorming Workshop</h3>
			<p>The FAST and AVOD brainstorming workshops were formatted similarly with affinity mapping, creative matrices, and voting on ideas. Specifically for the AVOD workshop, participants started with a warm-up activity to step into the shoes of the user by recalling as many titles from the main pages of Plex as possible. We then moved onto affinity mapping, where participants were sorted through existing challenges they saw with AVOD (through personal experience and user research), dividing them into groups and then, as a group, coming up with How Might We statements based off of them. From there, we used those HMW statements for our creative matrix and then voted on items via Monopoly money. Shown below are the affinity mapping and creative matrix activities.</p>

			<h3>AVOD Prioritization Session</h3>
			<p>Items from the AVOD workshop were pulled into the matrix for prioritization. Following the initial session, I broke out the items into different sections of where research was needed, what we needed more info on in general, what were mainly dev-focused items, what were items were already got started on from a design perspective, and miscellaous, sorting each column by priority order.</p>
